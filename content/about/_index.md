Hi! I’m Qiong (pronounced similarly to Chiong if that helps!).

I am currently an assistant professor in the [Institute of Statistics and Big Data](https://isbd.ruc.edu.cn/), Renmin University of China. 

### 🧑‍🎓 Education
- Ph.D. in Statistics, University of British Columbia, 2022  
- M.Sc. in Statistics, University of British Columbia, 2017
- B.Sc. in Statistics, University of Science and Technology of China ([School of the gifted young](https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm)), 2015

I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Jiahua Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XVr8B-AAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) during my graduate studies. 
Trained as a statistician, I have since ventured into the world of AI, where I explore how data and algorithms can uncover hidden patterns and narratives.


### 📚 Research Interests
My work bridges **statistics** and **machine learning**, with a focus on developing methods that make data a more powerful storyteller. Currently, my research explores:

- Mixture reduction with applications to federated learning, computer graphics
- Empirical likelihood for intelligent federated learning, handling label noise
- Tabular foundation models and in-context learning for statistical tasks

I am passionate about addressing real-world problems through statistical and AI-driven approaches, and I believe that data is the most compelling storyteller of all.
If you’d like to chat about statistics, AI, or the hidden narratives within your dataset, I’d be delighted to connect!
